## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to document the deployment of K3s cluster on Raspberry Pi. K3s is lightweigh and certified Kubernetes distribution targeted for Edge, IoT, CI and ARM environments. Raspberry PI is power efficient single board computer based on ARM architecture.

The use case I am interested in this project is to have an always on and power efficient kubernetes cluster for running various containerized applications as well as gain practical experience from deploying and managing such infrastructure over the time.
